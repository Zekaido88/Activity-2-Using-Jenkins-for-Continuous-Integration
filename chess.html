            <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
            <p>Chess is a strategic board game played between two players. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means the king is under threat of capture and cannot escape.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The game starts with each player controlling 16 pieces, arranged on an 8x8 board. Players take turns moving one piece at a time, following specific movement rules for each piece. The game can end in several ways: checkmate, stalemate, or resignation.</p>
